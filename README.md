I am a Software Engineer and Architect who has been active in the
industry since 2005. I have experience developing in real-time
operating systems, embedded Linux device drivers, and automated
factory acceptance testing. Since 2009 I have focused mainly on
information and logistics systems.

Most of my time professionally is spent maintaining legacy code.
As a result, I have developed a specialty applying DevOps practices
to older codebases, and since 2019 I have split my time doing this
across multiple internal projects.

In 2024 I began working with the open source community in the area
of security.
